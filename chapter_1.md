**War of Attrition
**
wo players are involved in a dis-
pute over an object. The value of the object to player i is vi > 0. Time
is modeled as a continuous variable that starts at 0 and runs indefinitely.
Each player chooses when to concede the object to the other player; if
the first player to concede does so at time t, the other player obtains the
object at that time. If both players concede simultaneously, the object
is split equally between them, player i receiving a payoff of vi/2. Time
is valuable: until the first concession each player loses one unit of payoff
per unit of time
